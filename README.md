GLP Visualizer
======
**GLP Visualizer** is a WordPress plugin designed for the Greater Louisville Project's website. It seamlessly embeds maps, graphs, and charts from a [Shiny server](https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) to give the end user a more interactive experience.

The architecture is currently a work in progress.
